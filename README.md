# HimalRisk-PyMC: Bayesian Rock-Mass Risk Assessment

### 🚨 Mission Objective
To quantify the statistical probability of structural failure in Himalayan tunnel systems and translate geological uncertainty into binding financial liability thresholds.

### 📉 The Decision Frontier
This engine replaces deterministic "Safety Factors" with **95% Credible Intervals**, allowing project managers to define "Unforeseeable Physical Conditions" (FIDIC Cl 4.12) with mathematical precision.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Engine:** Python 3.11+
*   **Probabilistic Engine:** PyMC (NUTS Sampling)
*   **Data Orchestration:** Pandas, NumPy, Xarray
*   **Visualization:** ArviZ (Posterior Diagnostics)
